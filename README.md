Fire safety is a critical concern in both homes and small businesses. Early detection can prevent damage and save lives. The problem here is most low-cost fire alarms do not provide remote alerts, making them ineffective if no one is nearby. For that this system uses an ESP32 with a flame sensor to detect fire, alert the user locally using a buzzer and LED, and remotely through Blynk notifications.
