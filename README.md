This project presents a smart fire detection and alert system using the ESP32 microcontroller. A flame sensor detects the presence of fire and immediately triggers a buzzer and LED for local alerts. Simultaneously, the system sends real-time push notifications to a mobile device using the Blynk IoT platform. The system also allows manual control of the buzzer and LED via the Blynk app. This project provides a cost-effective and responsive solution for early fire warning in homes or small facilities.
Fire safety is a critical concern in both homes and small businesses. Early detection can prevent damage and save lives. The problem here is most low-cost fire alarms do not provide remote alerts, making them ineffective if no one is nearby. For that this system uses an ESP32 with a flame sensor to detect fire, alert the user locally using a buzzer and LED, and remotely through Blynk notifications.
